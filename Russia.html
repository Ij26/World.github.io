        <h3>Russia</h3>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Russia, the largest country in the world, spanning two continents
            and multiple time zones, is a land of immense diversity, rich
            history, and breathtaking natural beauty. From the bustling
            metropolises of Moscow and St. Petersburg to the remote villages of
            Siberia and the rugged landscapes of the Caucasus Mountains, Russia
            offers visitors a wealth of experiences and attractions that capture
            the imagination and inspire awe. One of the defining features of
            Russia is its rich cultural heritage, which is reflected in its art,
            architecture, literature, and traditions. The country is home to
            some of the world's most iconic landmarks, including the Kremlin and
            Red Square in Moscow, the Hermitage Museum and Winter Palace in St.
            Petersburg, and the onion-domed churches of the Golden Ring cities.
            Visitors to Russia can explore centuries-old palaces and cathedrals,
            marvel at masterpieces by Russian artists like Ivan Aivazovsky and
            Wassily Kandinsky, or immerse themselves in the timeless works of
            authors like Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky..

          <span class="desc"
            >Muthumariamman Temple, also known as Arulmigu Sri Muthumari Amman
            Kovil is an ancient, colourful temple in Matala, Central Province,
            Sri Lanka. The name of the temple can be broken down into three
            parts, 'muthu' meaning pearl, 'mari' means rain and Amman means
            mother. Thus, this temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of
            rain and fertility. It is a magnificent, colorful temple, with tall
            towers, intricate carvings and realistic statues of gods and
            goddesses. The temple area was originally part of a paddy field,
            with a small statue under a tree, visited by the Hindus in
            Matale.The temple was built in 1874 by Nagalingam, his son Ramanath
            and around 100 designers, painters and architects from Tamil Nadu,
            and funded by Nattukkottai Chettiar. It contains 1008 statues of
            Hindu gods, and a beautifully decorated, 108 feet high Gopuram
            (tower) called Raja Koburam. This Buddhist and Hindu temple was
            immensely damaged during the anti-Tamil riots in July 1983, but it
            was immediately restored. Muthumariamman temple has five decorated
            chariots which represent different Hindu deities. The chariots
            parade around the town in a ceremony called Ther or Vettai
            Thiruvizha. This ceremony takes place on the day before Medin Poya,
            or Poya Say in March.The magnificent, colourful temple, with its
            tall towers, intricate carvings and realistic statues of gods and
            goddesses make it the pride of religion in Sri Lanka. Apart from
            being religiously and culturally significant for the Ceylonese,
            Muthumariamman temple in Matale is also a frequently visited tourist
            destination.</span

          <h3>Kazan</h3>
          <span class="desc"
            >Kazan, the capital city of the Republic of Tatarstan in Russia, is
            a vibrant and culturally rich destination nestled along the banks of
            the Volga River. With its unique blend of Russian and Tatar
            cultures, rich history, and stunning architecture, Kazan is a city
            that captivates visitors from around the world. One of the most
            striking features of Kazan is its rich cultural heritage, which is
            reflected in its diverse population and architectural landmarks. The
            city is home to a large Muslim Tatar community, as well as a
            significant Russian Orthodox population, creating a unique blend of
            traditions, customs, and cuisine. Visitors to Kazan can explore the
            historic Kazan Kremlin, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which features
            an impressive collection of mosques, cathedrals, and palaces that
            showcase the city's multicultural heritage. One of the most iconic
            landmarks in Kazan is the Qolşärif Mosque, a stunning example of
            Islamic architecture located within the walls of the Kazan Kremlin.
            With its soaring minarets, intricate mosaics, and expansive prayer
            hall, the mosque is a symbol of Tatar identity and a testament to
            the city's rich Islamic heritage. Nearby, the Annunciation
            Cathedral, with its gleaming white walls and golden domes, stands as
            a symbol of Russian Orthodox Christianity and a reminder of Kazan's
            diverse religious heritage. In addition to its cultural attractions,
            Kazan is also known for its vibrant arts and entertainment
            scene.</span

          <h3>The Russian Tundra</h3>
          <span class="desc"
            >The Russian Tundra, a vast and remote region in the northernmost
            reaches of Russia, is a land of stark beauty and extreme conditions.
            Covering approximately 11% of Russia's total land area, the tundra
            is characterized by its cold climate, barren landscapes, and unique
            ecosystems, making it one of the most inhospitable environments on
            Earth. One of the defining features of the Russian Tundra is its
            harsh climate, with long, bitterly cold winters and short, cool
            summers. Temperatures in the tundra can plunge well below freezing
            for much of the year, and the ground remains frozen for the majority
            of the year, a condition known as permafrost. Despite these extreme
            conditions, the tundra is home to a surprising variety of plant and
            animal life, adapted to survive in this challenging environment. The
            vegetation of the Russian Tundra is dominated by hardy, low-growing
            plants like mosses, lichens, and dwarf shrubs, which are able to
            thrive in the nutrient-poor soils and short growing season of the
            region. During the brief summer months, the tundra bursts into
            bloom, with colorful wildflowers carpeting the landscape and
            providing vital food sources for the tundra's resident
            wildlife..</span
